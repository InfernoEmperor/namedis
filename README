*** Author Name Disambiguation using CSLR and Wikipedia Taxonomy ***

Ambiguous names which correspond to many authors are a longstanding headache for bibliometric assessors and users of digital libraries. Author Name Disambiguation refers to splitting the bibliographic records by different authors with the same name into different clusters, so that each cluster belongs to one author, and each author's works are gathered in one cluster.

An authorâ€™s affiliation information is often only available in the fulltext of a paper, which is often difficult to obtain. To make our method as general as possible, we assume only bibliographic records are available, in the form as in DBLP. The information includes the list of coauthors, the published venue (conference or journal name), and the paper title.

Values in each feature serve as pieces of evidence used to decide whether two homonymous people are the same person. Coauthors and venues are two important features which have categorical values. During disambiguation, we need measure the similarity (or distance) between two clusters of papers. Naturally the feature values in each cluster form a set of categorical data, so a categorical set similarity measure is an important foundation of a disambiguation algorithm. 

Given two sets of categorical data, previous methods of name disambiguation use set similarity measures, such as Jaccard Coefficient or cosine similarity, which often fail when the sets are unbalanced in size, or when the frequencies of the elements in each set have distinctive patterns. We exploit the property that categorical sets from the same author follow similar distributions, and propose a generative probabilistic model to estimate the similarity of two sets. We name this novel similarity measure as Categorical Sampling Likelihood Ratio (CSLR).

We evaluate our system on two test sets extracted from the January 2011 dump of DBLP. Experiments show that our method significantly outperform one baseline method (by 4-5%), a representative previous method DISTINCT (by 5-6%) and a well-known system Arnetminer (http://arnetminer.org) (by 6-19%) in terms of macro-average F1 scores.

The whole system is implemented in Perl. It has totally around 20,000 lines of code. The complete set of source code, as well as the labeled data (All publications of 15 names. 5 are used as development set, 10 are used as test set) are here.

The paper titled Author Name Disambiguation using a Categorical Distribution Similarity has been accepted by ECML-PKDD 2012.
